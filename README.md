**CHATTRIX**

A Simple & Efficient Real-Time Chat Application in Java

CHATTRIX is a lightweight real-time chat application built using Java Sockets and Multithreading.
The goal of this project is to understand how real-world messaging systems work at a core networking level, before scaling it to web and mobile platforms.

This project is designed to grow step-by-step — from a basic socket chat to a WhatsApp-like system.
